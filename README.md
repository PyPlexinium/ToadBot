# How to install for hosting
### By: plexinium

- For a venv you need to create the venv and drop the requirements.txt and the main.py into its directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For hosting bare you will just need to install the requirements.txt the same way with `python pip install -r requirements.txt` 

- You might have to do it differently depending on hosting service.
